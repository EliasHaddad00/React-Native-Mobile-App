Hatch

This is Hatch, a mobile application helping creatives express their ideas in a more user friend platform while having the option to collaborate. We begin with an animated splash screen which leads you to Facebook login. The feed screen shows all your friend's posts and your posts as well. You can update this feed through an animated swiper.  The discover screen allows you to search and look at posts by category. The post screen allows you to post a card made up of topic, description, and image. The favorites screen will be populated with the posts you favorite, which is by clicking the eye on the card. The profile is a standard profile page that provides your information. You can swipe the screen to access the messages page, which is meant for collaboration.
